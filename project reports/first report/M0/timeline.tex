Timeline of the project tasks are listed below. Group members will work closely on each task to come up with a thorough analysis of power and performance results for deep learning on a CPU-GPU platform. 

\begin{itemize}
\item[M1 -] Choosing three SPLASH benchmarks (memory-intensive, compute intensive) for CPU
\item[-] Choosing three image classification deep neural networks with different scales for GPU
\item[-] Running CPU-GPU benchmarks individually to obtain the baseline for comparison purposes
\item[M2 -] Running CPU-GPU benchmarks jointly by changing frequency values for both CPU and GPU
\item[-] Analyzing power, performance, and temperature results 
\end{itemize}
