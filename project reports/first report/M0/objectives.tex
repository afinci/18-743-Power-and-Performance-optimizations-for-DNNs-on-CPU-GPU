In this project, we try to understand how various CPU workloads and frequency affect GPU performance and system power under thermal design power (TDP) constraint. We fix GPU to do inference for a image classification task. Meanwhile, we try to run meaningful tasks on CPU to use remaining resources of the embedded platform. We try to better understand what we can run on CPU Moreover, we try to analyze how CPU-GPU workloads affect temperature values where CPU and GPU share the same power budget. Furthermore, we try to better understand what type of CPU workloads has more instruction per cycle (IPC).
