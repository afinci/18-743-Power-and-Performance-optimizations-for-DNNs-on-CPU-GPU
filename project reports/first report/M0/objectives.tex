In this project, we try to understand how various CPU workloads and frequency affect GPU performance and system power under thermal design power (TDP) constraint. Moreover, we try to analyze how CPU-GPU workloads affect temperature values where CPU and GPU share the same power budget. Furthermore, we try to better understand what type of CPU workloads has more instruction per cycle (IPC).
