We try to understand how various CPU workloads and frequencies affect the performance of the deep learning task and system power under thermal design power (TDP) constraint. We fix GPU to do inference for a image classification task. Meanwhile, we try to run meaningful tasks on CPU to use the remaining resources of the embedded platform. Hence, we can better understand what is acceptable to run CPU without affeeting the performance of the deep learning task. Moreover, we try to analyze how CPU-GPU workloads affect temperature values where CPU and GPU share the same power budget. Last but not least, we hope to understand the trade-off between the performance of the CPU workload and the performance of the deep learning task by investigating the instruction per cycle (IPC) for CPU as well as the throughput for for the deep learning task (frame per second).
