Timeline of the project tasks are listed below. Group members worked closely on each task to come up with a thorough analysis of power and performance results for deep learning on a CPU-GPU platform. Team members worked jointly on this report and analysis.  

\begin{itemize}
\item[M2 -] Running CPU-GPU benchmarks jointly by changing frequency values for both CPU and GPU
\item[-] Analyzing power, performance, and temperature results 
\end{itemize}
