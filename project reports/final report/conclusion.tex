In this project, we analyze power and performance results of various deep neural networks running jointly with various CPU benchmarks on a CPU-GPU platform which is NVIDIA Jetson TX1. Power and performance analysis identify what is left to be done on CPU while GPU is running inference on deep neural network. 

Our comprehensive analysis (81 results with different configurations) shows us the best CPU benchmarks to run with various DNN configurations. Our results show that although people focus on GPU for running DNNs, role of CPU is not negligible in deep learning applications. CPU frequency still plays a significant role due to data preparation stage. Another important conclusion is that memory consumption of both CPU and GPU workloads affects overall power and performance. Therefore, memory consumption of both CPU and GPU benchmarks should be taken into consideration while running CPU-GPU benchmarks together. 

Group members worked closely on each task to come up with a thorough analysis of power and performance results for deep learning on a CPU-GPU platform. Team members worked jointly on this report and analysis.
